  <h1>Glowing Happiness</h1>
  <p>
    Glowing Happiness is a partially a guide, part modlist, to achieve how I think Fallout 4 should've been.<br>
    As per usual, this is yet another take to have an enhanced vanilla-like setup, without too many alterations.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Features and goals</h2>
    <ul class="featurelist">
      <li>Close to Vanilla</li>
      <li>Lore friendly</li>
      <li>Modularity</li>
    </ul>

    "Today, we need a nation of Minutemen,<br>
    citizens who are not only prepared to take arms,<br>
    but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom<br>
    as the basic purpose of their daily life and who are<br>
    willing to consciously work and sacrifice for that freedom."<br>
